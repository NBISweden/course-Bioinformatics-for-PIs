# Bioinformatics is...

- "The application of information technology to the field of molecular biology" ([wikipedia.org](wikipedia.org))

. . .

- Collection, archiving, organization, and interpretation of biological data

. . .

- Use of computers to address problems that are specific to biologists

. . .

- Informational technology + computer science + mathematics and statistics

# A Bioinformatician is Not a Unicorn

\Large

- A biologist may have broad knowledge of biology, but will have expertise in just part

. . .

- Similarly, \bf{a bioinformatician is not universal}

\normalsize

# Common Expected Duties?

\Large

- **Organize** other people's data
- **Analyze** other people's data
- **Educate** other people in the field of bioinformatics
- **Support** other people in analysis
- **Develop** tools for other people to use

\normalsize

# What Other's Need Bioinformatiticans to Be

\Large

- The expected competence(s) can then perhaps be seen as something that is lacking among research groups?
- Or is it just that they lack another set of hands (time and money, that is)?

\normalsize

# Things that Bioinformaticians Do - and How Much of What?

\Large

- **Organize** ~ 20%
- **Analyze** ~ 20%
- **Educate** ~ 20%

# What Should I Learn - As a Minimum?


---

# What Should I Learn - As a Minimum?

\Large

- Be able to look at your data?
    - Locate your data
    - Learn how to identify the "non-reproducible" parts of the data
    - Transfer data
    - ...

# Do I Need to Learn Programming?

. . .

\LARGE

No, but Why not?

\normalsize


---

# Some Words of Comfort:

\Large

- Actually programming can be easy
- Doesn't require knowledge of computer science

\normalsize


---

# Some Words of Comfort:

\Large

- A script is like a protocol:

\normalsize

```bash
for infile in *.fas
do
  alifile="${infile%.fas}.ali"

  # 1. Do multiple sequence alignment
  mafft --auto "$infile" > "$alifile"

  # 2. Infer a phylogenetic tree
  iqtree -s "$alifile" -nt AUTO -m TEST

done

```


---

# Some Words of Comfort:

\Large

- You start with an existing one and tweak it

\normalsize

# Some Words of Comfort:

You have a big advantage over the bioinformaticians:

- You generated the data
- You understand the biology
- You understand how things go wrong

# Do I Need to Learn Programming?

\Large

- Well, up to you (your loss...)

. . .

- \bf{Have your student(s) learn programming!}

    - Include a programming course as part of their PhD 
    - Have your student(s) gather other students in "study circles"
