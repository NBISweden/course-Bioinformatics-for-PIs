We will be using SNIC computational resources for some parts of the course. Let us know if you had not received an email on how to set your SNIC / Uppmax account.

For the practical sessions, we would like you to bring a lap-top computer with Wifi capacity, and with a "SSH client software" installed.
The software is used for communicating with a remote compute resource in a secure way.
These are typically pre-installed on MacOS and Linux operating systems.
For MS Windows, we can recommend, e.g., MobaXTerm [https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html),
or PuTTY [https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
